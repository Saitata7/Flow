🌊 Flow – Mood & Positive Energy Tracker

Flow is a next-generation mobile app designed to help people track moods, emotions, and daily actions that build a positive “flow state.” Unlike a simple habit tracker, Flow focuses on emotional well-being, mindfulness, and energy balance. Users can record feelings, share uplifting flows, join supportive plans, and see analytics that guide them toward sustained happiness.

✨ Core Features

Flow Entries: Track mood, energy, gratitude, focus, or custom signals.

Plans & Challenges: Create personal rituals or public/group challenges to cultivate better flow.

Gamification: Cheat mode (strict vs flexible scoring), badges, streaks, gentle reminders.

Community: Share flows, motivate peers, follow trainers/coaches.

Offline First: Local queue, caching, background sync.

Export & Integrations: Export data or integrate with wellness/health apps.

🚀 Tech Stack

Frontend: React Native, React Navigation, React Query, TypeScript.

Backend: Firebase (Auth, Firestore, Cloud Functions), Redis (leaderboards/cache).

Infra: GitHub Actions CI/CD, Terraform (optional).

Testing: Jest, React Testing Library.

Observability: Sentry, custom metrics.
